Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/second/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/second/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code. Color Customization: Users can select from various colors for their QR code. Engaging Animation: The QR code pieces animate upon generation, enhancing the user experience.

ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html.

Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*3Jr2kKt2gx3_jjkIRecdeQ.png\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*3Jr2kKt2gx3_jjkIRecdeQ.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*3Jr2kKt2gx3_jjkIRecdeQ.png\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*3Jr2kKt2gx3_jjkIRecdeQ.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"img/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications.

Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/img/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003eimage\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/img/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003estatic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications.

Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/img/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003estatic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/img/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003estatic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_242204/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/img/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003estatic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_242204/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_242204/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_242204/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_242204/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_242204/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_242204/image.png\"\u003e\nSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications.

Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_242204/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_242204/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003cstrong\u003e[Rich Sutton]\u003c/strong\u003e(\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\u003c/a\u003e) published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_242204/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_242204/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications.

Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications.

I was working on a marketing campaign and wanted to use QR codes to make it easy for customers to access a landing page. However, as I began searching for QR code generation tools online, I quickly realized that most services charge a fee for features like color customization and high-quality downloads.\nFrustrated with the paywalls, I thought, \u0026ldquo;Why should I pay for something I can build myself?\u0026rdquo; As a developer with some experience, I knew building a QR code generator wasn’t rocket science. Plus, I had heard of platforms like Cursor and Replit, which promised to help developers code without needing to write a lot of code. However, when I explored these tools, I found that setting them up felt like more effort than I wanted to invest for this project.\nThat’s when it hit me: why not try ChatGPT? I’d heard about how useful AI could be for coding assistance, and I was curious if it could help me build a functioning web app without having to do all the heavy lifting. So, I decided to experiment. This blog post documents how I successfully built a QR code generator web app with ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s assistance, the lessons I learned, and how you can do it too.\nSetting Up the Basics: Tools You\u0026rsquo;ll Need Before we dive into the coding, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you have the basic setup ready. Even though ChatGPT can provide a lot of the code, you\u0026rsquo;ll still need a few essential tools to get started:\n1. Text Editor You’ll need a simple text editor to write your code. Some popular options include:\nVS Code: A powerful, free code editor with a lot of features for web development. Sublime Text: A lightweight, fast editor perfect for small projects. Notepad++: Another free and easy-to-use option, especially for beginners. 2. Web Browser For testing your app, you’ll need a browser like Google Chrome or Firefox. Most modern browsers have built-in developer tools that will help you test and debug your web app.\n3. Running Your HTML Once you have your code written, you’ll want to open it in your browser. Here’s a simple way to run the app locally:\nWrite the HTML file: Save your file as index.html in a folder on your computer. Open in Browser: Double-click on the index.html file or drag it into a browser window. This will run your static HTML file directly. If you want a more robust way to run your app, you can use a tool like Python or a Node.js server, but for this basic setup, you can just open the HTML file directly in your browser. Building the QR Code Generator Web App with ChatGPT With my tools set up and my goal defined, I turned to ChatGPT to help me write the code for a QR code generator. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the process unfolded.\n1. Establishing the Basic Structure To begin, I asked ChatGPT for a basic HTML page setup with an input field and a button to generate the QR code. Here’s the initial structure ChatGPT suggested:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;QR Code Generator\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;url-input\u0026#34; placeholder=\u0026#34;Enter the URL here\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;generate-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Generate QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;qr-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; I copied this code into my text editor and saved it as index.html. After opening it in my browser, I could see the basic interface, though the QR code functionality wasn’t there yet. But this was a great start!\n2. Integrating a QR Code Library Next, I needed to generate the QR codes. ChatGPT introduced me to a JavaScript library called QRious. This library makes it easy to generate QR codes in the browser. ChatGPT provided a script tag to include the library and gave me code to generate a QR code based on the URL input.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include QRious Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrious@4.0.2/dist/qrious.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.getElementById(\u0026#39;generate-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var url = document.getElementById(\u0026#39;url-input\u0026#39;).value.trim(); if (url === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { alert(\u0026#39;Please enter a URL.\u0026#39;); return; } var qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; With this code, users could now enter a URL, click \u0026ldquo;Generate QR Code,\u0026rdquo; and see a QR code appear on the screen. It worked like magic!\n3. Adding Color Customization As a marketer, I wanted more than just black-and-white QR codes. I asked ChatGPT how I could let users change the color of their QR codes, and it suggested adding a color picker input:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;color\u0026#34; id=\u0026#34;color-input\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;#000000\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ChatGPT then modified the QRious initialization to use the color selected by the user:\nvar qr = new QRious({ element: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;qr-container\u0026#39;), value: url, size: 256, foreground: document.getElementById(\u0026#39;color-input\u0026#39;).value, }); This added a fun level of interactivity and allowed users to customize the QR code to their branding or style preferences.\n4. Implementing Animation Effects To make the app more engaging, I wanted to add animations to the QR code generation process. I asked ChatGPT for ideas, and it introduced me to anime.js, a JavaScript library for creating animations. We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.

Sutton argued that, in the long run, general-purpose methods that leverage massive computation have always outperformed human-designed, domain-specific approaches.\nThis observation resonated deeply with many in the AI community, especially considering it predated the formal recognition of scaling laws that now guide much of our approach to AI development.\nSutton’s vision was brilliant in its foresight. Before the era of multi-billion parameter models and scaling law theories, he pinpointed the core principle that would dominate modern AI: computation over human intuition. Sutton’s message was that progress in AI is not about building in our knowledge of the world — it’s about using computation and general learning mechanisms to discover it. Today, with the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4, we see his vision manifest, as these models generalize across tasks without specialized structures designed by humans.\nNot everyone agreed with Sutton’s conclusions. Rodney Brooks, a pioneer in robotics and AI, wrote a response titled “A Better Lesson”, arguing that Sutton’s insistence on computation overlooked a critical point: practical AI systems often need carefully designed components to be efficient and effective. Brooks pointed out that even celebrated successes in deep learning — like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition — embody human knowledge in their architectures. CNNs are designed to understand translational invariance, meaning they can recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image. Brooks highlighted that without such built-in efficiencies, the computational costs of AI would skyrocket, and the human contribution to AI would simply shift from embedding knowledge to designing computational frameworks and datasets.\nFrom Scaling Models to Scaling Inference Over the years, we have witnessed a shift in focus within the AI community. Initially, the emphasis was on building larger models — scaling up neural networks and training them on massive datasets. This led to breakthroughs like GPT-3, which surprised even its creators with its emergent capabilities. However, we are now seeing a transition towards leveraging agentic systems to scale computation at the inference stage, not just during training.\nToday, most of us use LLMs in a zero-shot mode — prompting the model to generate an output token by token without revisiting or revising its previous work. This approach is akin to asking someone to write an entire essay without backtracking or editing: it’s impressive that LLMs manage to perform so well in this manner, but it’s far from the iterative, reflective process humans use to produce high-quality work.\nEnter agent workflows. By using agents, we can guide the LLM through multiple iterative cycles: planning, researching, drafting, reflecting, and revising. Instead of writing an essay in one go, an LLM agent can plan an outline, decide if more information is needed, write a draft, read it for flaws, and iterate. This process is crucial for improving the quality of AI outputs and mirrors the way human writers refine their work over time. Recent experiments show that when GPT-3.5 is wrapped in an iterative agent loop, it can outperform GPT-4 in tasks like coding — underscoring the power of extending computation to inference, not just model size.\nThe Modern Contradiction: Human-Designed Logic Loops Despite the impressive results, there’s a fundamental contradiction at play. The agentic systems we see today — those that iterate, revise, and self-reflect — are still fundamentally tied to human-designed logic loops. We create the rules that dictate when the LLM should plan, search for more information, or revise. This is still a far cry from Sutton’s vision of minimizing human intervention entirely and letting computation handle everything autonomously.\nRodney Brooks’ critique of Sutton’s vision is relevant here. Brooks argued that eliminating human input from AI design is impractical and can be counterproductive. Human knowledge, when thoughtfully applied, reduces the need for excessive computation and helps avoid pitfalls that purely data-driven models might fall into — like the inability to recognize a stop sign with tape on it because the model lacks a fundamental understanding of what colors stop signs are supposed to be.\nThis tension raises a key question: are agentic systems that rely on human-designed loops really a step towards the kind of autonomy Sutton envisioned, or are they simply shifting human ingenuity to a different part of the process? Perhaps the real “better lesson” is that true AI advancement requires a balance — an interplay between computational power and human expertise. We need methods that can utilize vast computation, but we also need mechanisms to make that computation efficient, targeted, and meaningful.\nCREAO’s Vision: The Next-Gen AI Agent Infrastructure At CREAO, we believe the future lies in bridging this gap. Our mission is to create an infrastructure that allows AI to design agents with minimal human intervention. The vision is that agents should be able to dynamically create, adapt, and execute workflows without relying on pre-specified logic crafted by humans. Imagine an agent that can draft a document, determine when it needs more information, gather that information, and integrate it — all without explicit instructions.\nWe want to build agents that plug into any system and perform tasks as adaptable human labor would. Just like humans can learn and adapt to different tasks with sufficient training, the agents we envision should be able to do the same. Whether it’s performing diagnostics on software, drafting and revising content, or conducting complex multi-step planning — our goal is to develop agents that can handle it all, autonomously.\nThe infrastructure we are building at CREAO is designed to support this vision. We aim to create a foundation where agents can learn to build their own workflows, iteratively improve, and plug into diverse environments without requiring a pre-designed script for every situation. This is the next step towards realizing Sutton’s dream — a step towards agents that are not just executors of human-designed logic but are, in essence, designers of their own intelligence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post3_241104/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"alt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/posts/post3_241104/image.png\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: \u003ca href=\"https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/\"\u003eLangChain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_S._Sutton\"\u003eRich Sutton\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e published a thought-provoking piece titled \u003ca href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“The Bitter Lesson”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, reflecting on the progress of artificial intelligence over the last seventy years.

We decided to animate the QR code pieces as they appeared on the screen.\n\u0026lt;!-- Include anime.js Library --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; We added an animation that would make the QR code pieces \u0026ldquo;break apart\u0026rdquo; and then come together again:\n// Animation code using anime.js anime({ targets: \u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;, scale: [0, 1], duration: 2000, easing: \u0026#39;easeInOutQuad\u0026#39; }); This made the app feel more dynamic and exciting for users.\n5. Adding Download Functionality To complete the functionality, I needed a way for users to download their QR code once it was generated. ChatGPT helped me add a download button:\n\u0026lt;button id=\u0026#34;download-btn\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Download QR Code\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; And provided JavaScript code to trigger the download:\ndocument.getElementById(\u0026#39;download-btn\u0026#39;).addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { var canvas = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;#qr-container canvas\u0026#39;); var link = document.createElement(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;); link.href = canvas.toDataURL(\u0026#39;image/png\u0026#39;); link.download = \u0026#39;qr_code.png\u0026#39;; link.click(); }); Now, users could not only generate but also download their custom QR codes.\nDeploying the Web App on Vercel With the core features in place, it was time to deploy the app. ChatGPT recommended using Vercel, a platform designed for easily deploying web applications. After pushing the code to a GitHub repository and linking it with Vercel, I was able to deploy the app live with just a few clicks.\nCheck out the live app here: QR Code Generator Web App\nFinal Product Features QR Code Generation: Users can input a URL to generate a QR code.
